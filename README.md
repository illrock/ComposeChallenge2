To make application work, you will need to fill some variables in local.properties file:
- apiBaseUrl
- apiUsername
- apiPassword

For release build, you'll also need jks key file, and keystore.properties file with all the access data:
- keyAlias
- keyPassword
- storeFile
- storePassword

Todo:

- Pinch-zoom big images
- Day-night theme via compose
- Autoscroll small pictures by timer until user interacts
